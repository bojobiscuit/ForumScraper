        <tr><td>Allen</td><td>150</td><td>Big Dic Chaney rolled up to the red carpet in a XL stretch Hummer and brought the whole state of Texas with him to the party. There were a lot of people that popped out of the limo. I mean, seriously, it was a problem. They were all pretty drunk too cuz we sippin that Henny in the back of the Hummy, feel me? As far as threads go, I brought the custom Giorgio Armani threads out and actually had Armani himself there to make sure that we didn't have any Janet Jackson-esque wardrobe malfunctions. You know I do it big with the chains and whatnot, so I had to bring the classic Bun B chain out of the closet for this special occasion. And of course, you know I brought the baddest bitches to flank me. I won't say any names but they were young, fine, and certified dimes.</td></tr><tr><td>bluesfan55</td><td>164</td><td>I was one of the entire Irish national team that was invited begrudgingly by the British hosts to the SHL/SMJHL Awards. Of course, I sat with the Irish team. Roman Augustus sat to one side of me, Oisin Fletcher the other. I was wearing a green suit, custom made by an Irish designer, with a white shirt and orange tie to symbolise the colors of the Irish flag. I also wore these colors to piss off the snobby British hockey fans. For so long, they've considered themselves better. Well, not anymore. A CBC interviewer came up to me. "Joey, what's it like to be a part of the best team in IIHF history?", he asked. "It's f****** great, man! To celebrate this in the UK in front of the world's snobbiest hockey fans is a dream come true." I then mouthed the words "GO F*** YOURSELVES" to the British fans as I walked in. Did I mention that I was drunk? I probably should've.</td></tr><tr><td>Bonk</td><td>190</td><td>When Don Cherry approached Lil' Manius on the red carpet. Lil' Manius sharted just a little bit as he was in awe of the moment. Manius was exiting the limousine in support of Jason Visser, who was in attendance to the Season 44 SHL Awards Ceremony as he was nominated for Anton Razov Trophy. For his season 44-playoff performance during the Jets Challenge Cup run. Lil’ Manius was already a little upset, as he was not going to be one of the first 30 people in attendance so that meant one thing, no free chips or pop. At least he would be able to take part in devouring numerous Izzy Dogs, which were available at the counter. So needless to say Manius very preoccupied with stomach got out of the limo and when he made eye contact with Cherry who was approaching with a microphone, his body released. At first Manius was relieved, as it was just a fart although after a moment he knew it was more. Lil’ proceeded to stand his ground and struggle through a couple of questions from Don before quickly excusing himself to address the situation. 

Words~191</td></tr><tr><td>BoucherFan12</td><td>159</td><td>Benjamin Blue wanted to come to the awards show in style, so he came to the event in a slick 1982 convertible — which was barely working. He came out of the car with his husky in his arms, carrying her wherever he went. He was wearing some decent shades with cracks in them, no gel on his thigh curly mullet (of course). He was wearing a pink and lime dotted suit with a white shirt. As Blue was walking down the carpet he signed many jerseys and rookie cards, and took pictures with many fans. An interviewer for a news company asked Blue some questions about what he thought about his rookie season (he answered that it was absolutely atrocious), and if he though he would win the SHL rookie of the year award (he answered he hope he doesn’t because then a lot of people would be angry). He sat quietly during the show, sitting beside Flacko and Fantobens.</td></tr><tr><td>Durden</td><td>162</td><td>My red carpet experience was a first, and a new type of event. I've never been a part of a large scale awards show, so it was exciting but frightening. 

I went by myself. It's easier to pick up women when you don't already have one on your arm. I don't have anyone in my life right now so it just seemed natural.

I came dressed in my blue Givenchy suit and my brown Magnanni loafers. I knew I had to look the part of an experienced SHL player. 

I drove up in my Tesla, as there is nothing more stylish than one of those. I don't need a lambo to scream that I'm awesome. Just elegance and class. 

I had a lot of fun with my Scarecrow buddies, and really got to know more of the Renegades while I wait to be called up. I'm excited for the future and hope to hear my name called on that stage very soon.</td></tr><tr><td>efiug</td><td>278</td><td>Petr Mikulak had dressed up nicely for the SMJHL Awards in San Diego, well as nicely as he could have dressed. Petr has a firm hatred on suits and the like, partially due to their monotonous designs and uncomfortable fittings. He had arrived with all of the other Whalers rookies, of which he was the least excited about this event. After about an hour of the show had passed Petr had decided to make his way outside because he was hot and sweaty in a room full of other hot and sweaty people. He cooled down outside for a bit and played around on his phone for a few minutes before attempting to make his way back in. He tried the door he just came out of and it had locked behind him, so with nothing else to do he headed towards the front to get back inside. Unfortunately neither of the guards recognised him and he didn't have his ID thingy that let him in the first time. He tried calling his Whalers team mates but all of them were watching the awards show. He even tried pulling up pictures of himself on his phone and showing it to the guards, but they told him to get lost before they called the cops on him. Petr was defeated and was nearly about to leave altogether when he bumped into Barret McCarthy, who was nominated for an award and most likely running late. After a brief exchange where he explained why he wasn't inside Petr was let in as McCarthy's "guest". The rest of the night was all fun and soon Petr forgot all about being locked out.</td></tr><tr><td>ej27</td><td>172</td><td>Lockhart wasn't nominated for anything at the SMJHL awards. In fact, he wasn't even invited to attend the show. He watched it from his parents' couch on their big screen TV, wearing some crappy old sweats and eating the creamy inside layer out of an entire pack of Oreos. WHATEVER, DON'T JUDGE. If he had been in attendance though, Lockhart probably would have picked up a sweet new suit from some department store. Maybe Sears, maybe Macy's--who can say? Maybe a new pair of shoes too, some new dress socks. He has a favorite tie, so he definitely would have worn that. He probably would have Ubered to the show from the hotel, but since this is a fancy event, he would have sprang for the LUX Uber. He probably would have brought his step mom as his date and, let's be real, since he wasn't nominated, they would have ditched out early to go have dinner at some crappy diner and talk about what everyone else was wearing or talking about.</td></tr><tr><td>Flames1848</td><td>176</td><td>Mike McKorsy ath the Season 45 Award Show

Mike McKorsy attends the Award Show wearing nice jeans with a San Francisco 49ers Jersey.
"Of course there is Number 85 (George Kittle, Tigh End) on my back. He is one the sport-idols that inspires me. Young, talented and a good locker room guy and leader", answered the young goalie as he was asked by the media about his dressing. How he arrived at the red carpet? He came with the bus. One block away there was the bus stop from line 42. "From Halifax to San Diego I used the greyhound bus. The raiders would have bought me a plan ticket, but I don’t want that they use that money on me, they can use it for helping our youth to play hockey." After the ceremony McKorsy wasn’t long on the Awards-Party. "The last bus (Line 42) went on 10.30 pm and I want to be at the rink in Halifax tomorrow for the next training session. I will party when I will get my first award", jokes the young german goalie.</td></tr><tr><td>FlappyGiraffe</td><td>0</td><td><a href="https://i.imgur.com/PClEXYI.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PClEXYI.jpg"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td>FuzzSHL</td><td>206</td><td><a href="https://66.media.tumblr.com/0adbf9ab126f3eae6d9cbe87c0749698/tumblr_os104rBzes1uxcb2eo2_500.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/0adbf9ab126f3eae6d9cbe87c0749698/tumblr_os104rBzes1uxcb2eo2_500.gif"></a><br>This was a moment that not even Michael Fox expected - his first red carpet moment. Not really knowing what to expect, Scarecrows goaltender Aleister Cain accompanied Fox, along with Fox's girlfriend and both Fox's and Cain's family. This was the first time Fox had been seen with his girlfriend, and for most it was the first time she had been heard of - Fox opting to keep that part of his private life, well, private. Fox wore his best blue suit, and when asked who designed it, his response was "I don't know, Belk's or something? I need a new suit." While Fox wasn't nominated for any awards, and Cain wasn't nominated for many, the two still had a good time and celebrated the Scarecrow's Four Star Cup victory again, relishing in the nearly inaudible groans from Detroit players. 

Fox not only is hoping to return next year with a nomination, but is also expecting himself to be. Of all the those in management, of all the fans, players, and family that have high expectations for Fox, he has the highest expectations for himself of them all, though he will never admit it. "I'm really only focused on winning another Cup and making the team better around me."</td></tr><tr><td>gordieboom</td><td>155</td><td>Gordie is not a big fan of red carpet parties, so when he got an invitation from the organization he didn't jumped in the air of excitement. He doesn't like the formal hassle and went to the big party with a bit reluctance. He picked out a normal black suit in his wardrobe, nothing too fancy. Good friend and teammate TT Wawazat picked him up in his yellow/black Mercedes Benz S550. At the party, none of the paparazzi seem to knew Gordie at that time, and luckily he didn't need to answer any questions. Offcourse he sat in the same row as all of his St.Louis buddies, hoping one of his nominated teammates would win an award. Which surprisingly was not Ty Hoover, who sat three seat next to Gordie with a grumpy face throughout the evening. TT Wawazat tried to cheer him up for not being nominated with one of his jokes, but he couldn't get more than a light smile on his face.</td></tr><tr><td>GrilledTwinkiez</td><td>169</td><td>Fuck boys what a night eh, so here’s the story. I’m hanging with Tigole Bitties (@ace) we hot out the limo decked out head to toe in Louis Vuitton. Obviously they see Tigs and go wild the dudes an absolute stud on the ice boys, I roll out behind him piggy backing the applause he got like it was all my own. We get inside and start slamming on some pink Whitney’s from our sponser New Amsterdam Vodka. Rocket news reporter comes up to us and started asking us about getting girls, I jump in and say well fuck Tigs here just throws up a pic on the IG and got the DM’s flooded for after the game. For me it’s more work, I gotta go to the bar, find an average girl, mention I play in the show, here’s how I seal the deal. Put a bottle of vodka down her hatch, in her eyes I’ve gone from a 6 to an 8, and that’s how we getter done boys!</td></tr><tr><td>hhh81</td><td>184</td><td>After skipping the S44 SMJHL Awards show (where he was nominated for several awards), Cassius Darrow was forced to attend the S45 Awards show. He wore a nicely tailored blue suit, a freshly pressed white shirt, brown wingtipped shoes, and a dark blue tie. He rode to the event in Nick Brain's SUV, alongside fellow nominees Knute Knurtsson, Lillie Jacobs, and fellow supportive teammates Jakub "Hatman" Novak and The Yurk (Yuri Ushakov). While his teammates took in the red carpet, Darrow snuck into the theater, grabbed himself a water from the cash bar, and sat silently in the corner, hiding from the hubbub of cameras, rich people, and hangers on. Fellow SMJHL stars and Team Germany prospects Derek Bohne and Sanyi Kocsis found him in the corner and said hello on their way to their seats. Eventually Novak and Jacobs found him and convinced Darrow to go in to their seats. Once inside, Darrow watched the awards quietly, forcing a small smirk when his name was announced for a few awards. Afterwards, the Raptors piled back into Brain's SUV and went their separate ways.</td></tr><tr><td>James Truong</td><td>210</td><td>For the SHL/SMJHL award show that was held in San Diego was a spectacular time to celebrate the best of the best this past season. I did not expect many people to know who i was or even recognize me on the red carpet, but i was surprised to hear people say my name and ask for a picture and autograph. I wore a typical black suit and tie, black dress shoes and a Rolex watch (the watch was a bit much for me, but my girlfriend wanted me to have an accessory on). Speaking of my girlfriend, she was my plus one for the event and she loved every moment of the festivities. Some TV news reporters approached me to ask some questions such as how are you enjoying the red carpet, who are you most excited to see and my fashion style for this evening. No controversy or social media buzz was created by me as i don't like to the center of attention. I got to sit in the same row as my former teammate Willy Mack so we got to catch up for a bit.

My goal for the future is to one day accept a SHL/SMJHL award and for a good reward as well!

Words : 212</td></tr><tr><td>Jenny</td><td>248</td><td>Mia Landvik has had the opportunity to attend a fair number of awards shows over the course of her long career, but rarely because of her own individual performance. She was incredibly honoured to be nominated for the Stevens for the first time in her career, and having announced her retirement just before the awards show, she was determined to make the best of the night. She, of course, brought her husband Mikko Linna as her date, and the two left their twin toddlers with grandparents so they could indulge in a night out. Although Mia didn't win the Stevens, the show was a great opportunity to catch up with all the familiar faces around the league that Mikko hadn't seen in a while and that Mia was about to have much less opportunity to see regularly. 

More than that, though, the best part of the red carpet for Mia, hands down, was getting to talk to the fans and do what little she could to repay them for being great over the years - especially all the young kids who told Mia she inspires them to play hockey themselves. She was able to leave after the show reminded of the reason she put so much blood and sweat into the game over the years and return home with her family, confident that she made the impact on the league that she wanted to and content with her choice to move on to a new chapter of her life.</td></tr><tr><td>Jepox</td><td>164</td><td>Nolan Sawchuk attended the SMJHL awards and had a hell of a night with his two teammates Nickolas Klaus and Sanyi Kocsis. All three of them won awards, and had a hell of a night living it up in the spotlight. The three of them attended the event in matching green suits, looking like a bunch of god damn Leprechauns. It was really a sight to see, but they came away with a bunch of awards so nobody could chirp them too hard. The three climbed out of a limo that I'm sure cost quite a bit of money, and proceeded to immediately get kicked out of their seats, as they weren't actually sitting in the right seats. After the event the three created a ton of controversy as they proceeded to make even the worst of drunks look like a casual drinker and hit the town absolutely mobbing. All in all it was an interesting night that I'm sure nobody will soon forget.</td></tr><tr><td>JRed94</td><td>188</td><td>191 words

I hopped out of the stretch G wagon with my lineys--Mikkel Haugen and Kire Yelkrab --in tow. We were streaming live to instagram in the whip, but the camera flashes sidelining the red carpet were extreme on another level. This does not really phase the boys or I though, as we know we look good. Look good, feel good -- am I right? We're rocking suits straight out of the roaring twenties and we all have on matching these nasty feathered fedoras. Think Al Capone. We're putting on for Chicago and looking good while doing so. We're just having a time on the carpet answering questions. We see Biznasty doing interviews and he beckons me over. We all know Bizs' shtick so when he begins questioning me on my wheeling ability and my teammates' units I again remain unphased. It was not til after I bumped in to our coach, GM, and owner that I started to check my self. Because coach game me a handful of breath mints and told me that I needed these more than he. Guess that limo ride was a little too lit.</td></tr><tr><td>JVMjrDOT</td><td>2</td><td>PBE PT</td></tr><tr><td>karey</td><td>176</td><td>The Red carpet is a time on which most players dress well, celebrate their accomplishments, and bring their significant others. However, to raise their PR and perception around the league, the Stampede players decided to for go festivities and donate their tickets to the local YMCA to allow local youth to come to the event. However there was a mixup and those tickets that were meant to go to local youth, ended up being donated to the SPCA. Rather than young boys and girls coming to the event, stray cats and dogs were instead brought and as you can imagine, in Buffalo fashion, were unruly animals flinging their shit all over the place, ruining the fun for everybody else.

This mixup has been rumoured to have been caused by the Augment himself, who as of now has refused to make a statement. The Buffalo stampede organization has issued an apology and has offered dry cleaning to all those affected. They have also made it known that they are so fucking happy with how things turned out.</td></tr><tr><td>LarksTongue</td><td>169</td><td>Being an astute diplomat during his time at N7, Shepard was right at home mingling at the S45 Awards show. From the start Shepard turned heads arriving in his obnoxious M35 Mako that took up the entire road when he arrived. After stepping out of the Mako rocking his suit from the late 2100s he brought some of his crew members along like Garrus much to the shock of his fellow SHLPA players. But the SHL is a diverse league so no one cared at all. Garrus has been thinking of joining when the time is right when he’s done his calibrations. 

Shepard also brought some of the strongest Krogan liquor for all. Shepard got a few of his teammates a bit tipsy. And after said drinks, Shepard was interviewed and asked what he thinks of the game of hockey and how he enjoys it. With a sluggish smile and lazy look, Commander Shepard said quite assuredly “Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space!”</td></tr><tr><td>Leafs4ever</td><td>199</td><td>The Season 45 Awards Ceremony was one to remember because of the dominant season we had in Edmonton. We had a lot of people up for awards so we all decided to go to the awards together. The general manager rented a huge limo and took all of us to the ceremony together. The SHL gave us seats in the front row, a good hint about the number of awards we would win.

The limo dropped us off at the beginning of the red carpet and we started our walk down it. I was wearing a really slick Calvin Klein suit with a Blizzard blue tie. Cuddles and I were walking down the carpet, answering questions together. We were all pulling for Cudds to win Playoff MVP so I hitched my wagon to him that night. We were asked all kinds of questions, like our place in history after the greatest season in SHL history, my personal SHL record for highest plus/minus, and other hockey questions. After what felt like hours, we all finally made our way into the ceremony and took up the front two rows. That was the night to crown the Blizzard and we cleaned house.

I was excited to travel overseas and meet this old lady face to face. When we got to London we were told some specific rules for interacting with her and it was going to be a great night. I went to a fancy suit maker in town that has been in business for over 100 years. They made me the finest suit by hand to fit my perfectly chiseled body and massive thighs. The team was taking a few limo's to the red carpet where we would get a chance to shake hands face to face with the Queen herself. I've heard she's reptilian so I wanted get up close and see for myself. When my turn to meet her came I was shocked at how small this bitch was. Maybe 4 feet tall? She smelled like my grandma mixed with the inside of a wet soggy airplane from the 70's that was heavily smoked in.</td></tr><tr><td>Mike Izzy</td><td>0</td><td><a href="https://i.imgur.com/pEF8nOG.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pEF8nOG.png"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td>monkey10pts</td><td>151</td><td>It was a magical night for James Dekens. He strolled into red carpet event in a 1969 Shelby Mustang GT, his dream car. Accompanied by his courageous sheep dog Ned, he waltzed his way down the walkway with the red velvet underneath. Dressed head to toe in Manhattan Rage gear, he didn't give a shit about what score E! News was about to give his get-up. Seated between Carson Daly and Fred Durst, they briefly spoke about who she gave head to first. The news of free unlimited New Amsterdam Vodka and as many dirty hookers you could handle were introduced to him by Paul "BizNasty" Bissonette. Craig Finley was amongst Deken's entourage as they walked the walk with the celebrities. Most people had no idea who the two were. Pink Whitneys were had, as were the fun times, and Dekens was sure to forget it in all the right ways.

@hats_4_days</td></tr><tr><td>Narconis</td><td>158</td><td>Geezus Kryyst showed up to the awards ceremony driving a Delorean fully updated with modern technologies. As he stepped out of the gull wing doors, he was wearing a pair of sweatpants and one of those T-shirts that look like a tuxedo. He was holding a bottle of Jagermeister and a 4-pack on Monster. When asked “who are you wearing” he replied “No idea.. I just wear what’s comfortable”. Accompanying Geezus was Sunny, a member of K-Pop group “Girl’s Generation”, She was dressed in a gorgeous gown that honestly made Geezus look quite out of place. During the awards Geezus was seated next to his agent, SHL Hall of Famer Barney Stinson. During the awards Geezus caused a bit of a scene when he ran up to the stage to accept an award he didn’t win. Eventually he was escorted to the SHL Awards Penalty Box, a glassed off room where Geezus spent the rest of show.

Words: 157</td></tr><tr><td>NorwegianDemon</td><td>174</td><td>Anders Christiansen lived what he would call a surreal experience at the last awards show. Behind kind of shy, Christiansen try to avoid having the public attention fix on him, but he decides to fight his fear by appearing on the red carpet at the award show. Anders invited his father to come with him to the awards show. His father has always been a huge hockey fan, something quite rare in Norway, and Anders wanted him to be able to meet some of the current best players in the game and they also got introduced to some of the legends of the SHL that attend the show this year. Christiansen and his father arrived at the show in a taxi cab. They were both wearing standard black suits they own, since they are to the kind to get too fancy. Overall, Christiansen really appreciate his time at the award show and hope to be able to come next year with his name up on the board for one of the SHL trophies.

Or they lost the invite during the move from San Francisco to New Orleans. Who knows really? However I did watch the show. Watched the SHL stars show up with their super model girlfriends, watched the guys and gals win their awards, and watched the host nervously try to impress people that have no clue who he is. All of this from the comfort of my couch in good old Salem, OR with a blunt in one hand and my phone in another I sat in my birthday suit and watched as players won awards I will never have a shot at. I spent the first portion of the awards show getting as blazed as possible to get the creative juices flowing and then once it was all said and done I washed it down with a bottle of Kraken rum that I had been saving for a few years because of laziness. Boring, I know but it hopefully gets better as the invites start rolling in as I earn more respect in the league.</td></tr><tr><td>Rabidsponge21</td><td>180</td><td>The attire for Ludwig was pretty simple honestly. Most people were dressed to the nines, wearing their best suits, ties etc. What did he wear? The most socially acceptable casual suit you can imagine. He spent money on making sure it was lined with comfortable materials and that it had room to breathe when he hit the Buffet. Why? Well if history has taught him anything at this point, is that whenever he is elected for an award anymore, to just accpet his name isn't getting called and this was no exception. So rather than focus on what he won't be voted for, he goes to have fun, enjoy the free paid meal and event and get the most out of this once every 5+ season experience for him. Sneaking in a flask with his favourite rum, he spent most of his evening enjoying it with his wife and friends and was barely paying attention when they announced his name as part of those elected, so it was really a good night. Here's to hoping for another free dinner this season.</td></tr><tr><td>sarmo</td><td>172</td><td>Terrance Nova has previously disagreed with award shows and their inconsistent staffing, and when he was invited to attend the ceremony in season 45, he did not want to miss out on a chance to give a criticizing speech. Ironically, the show was also his first red carpet experience and he came through with it in style. He pulled up in his brand new purchased matte black Nissan Skyline with limo tint windows and hydraulic touch to represent his Southside Htown culture. Young Nova also brought a good friend Slim Thug, a local rapper and good friend, followed by a couple groupies. After walking the carpet, Nova took of his ray bans and gave his speech on how to improve the integrity and consistency of the award show and ended the schooling with autographs and a positive note. Later, the league did fine Nova for the public criticism but it's not something he didn't expect, it just felt reassuring for the long time Chief whos seen his teammates get snubbed too many times.</td></tr><tr><td>sharksisback</td><td>396</td><td>When I stepped out of my 2014 Nissan Sentra at the SMJHL Awards show, I was honestly puzzled by all of the media attention. Like, I only had about 10 points last season, and I wasn't nominated for anything at all. Why the fuck are the reporters talking to me? Whatever, it's gonna be a long fucking night. I wore a nice blue Giorgio Armani two-piece windowpane design suit. Sophia wore a black Louis Vuitton dress that made me question how the hell I was gonna make it through this awards show without making sexual remarks that these dumbass reporters would probably hear and then report because that's what those vultures do. The media asked me questions like "Did you really beat Kit Smeb up?" and "Do you feel privileged that Sophia didn't dump your ass onto the streets for cheating on her with all of those prostitutes?" The same dumb shit I deal with in Halifax, cool. I get down to my row in this shithole building that they dressed up into a classy awards banquet. I think they call it Staples Center. I look down my row that these fuckers assigned me to because apparently I'm back in grade school, and I see Matt sitting with some foreign looking lady. That's a red flag for her future. Unfortunately, I can't sit next to him because I have to sit next to some dude who's chatting it up with Anastasia O'Koivu. Who is that? Goddamnit, it's fucking Nikolai Evans. I sit down next to him and exchange pleasantries. After like an hour of watching a bunch of nerds go on the stage, I just started playing on my phone and suddenly I just hear some yelling out of my left ear. I just assume Sophia slapped the shit out of a Falcon but then I remember she's on my right. Evans and O'Koivu are just in a fucking screaming match. O'Koivu's yelling "I SHOULD'VE BEEN THE FIRST OVERALL PICK FOR CARRYING YOUR ASS IN WORLD JUNIORS" and Evans is yelling "HAMILTON SHOULD'VE DRAFTED DOSKOCIL OVER YOUR SORRY ASS". I'm just laughing my ass off because this is the only interesting thing to happen all night. Sophia elbowed me because apparently it isn't okay to laugh at that. Anyways, the night didn't get any more interesting after that. I better win at the next one or I'm gonna make a scene.</td></tr><tr><td>slothfacekilla</td><td>0</td><td><a href="https://i.imgur.com/JyZSfDp.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JyZSfDp.png"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td>soyna87</td><td>203</td><td>Although the fact that Zach wasn't nominated for anything in the award, he decided that he still wanted to check this iuo while getting a bit hammered at the bar because, why not?

He wore a classic black and white suit, but he was flashing a red old bow tie that he have since a few years ago. His mom gave it to him for prom, and you can bet your ass that hellh keep it and wear it with pride!

He went to shook hands with a few guy and gals and congratulate a few others, and bee line the bar so he could order an old-fashioned rum and coke, made with a brown spiced rum with a touch of lime. He sipped a few while watching others get drunk and talk. Zach is a kind of a private person, and he enjoys watching life going on around him. He had a good time laughing at the others making a fool of themselves, that's for sure!</td></tr><tr><td>SpartanGibbles</td><td>208</td><td>Collin Gibbles hit the red carpet for the SMJHL awards show in style. Sporting an Anaheim Outlaw's themed suit(Dark Red Jacket, Pants, Shoes, and Tie) with Minnesota Chiefs accessories(Dark Green Tie Tack, Pin, Pocket Square). He arrived with his newly announced girlfriend Anna Kendrick who sported a flowing red gown to match her partner. Both of the couples outfits were designed in tandem by Anaheim local designer Valerie Wright. The couple arrived in Gibbles new 2015 Mustang that was featured on a recent episode of SHL Cribs. The couple answered a multitude of questions from the press ranging in topics from their recently revealed relationship, to the previous SMJHL season, and even Kendrick's new projects in Hollywood. 

While not nominated for any of the years awards, Gibbles was there to support fellow Outlaws players who were. He was seated in the same row as Mathias Seger, Hiro Fujikawa, and Jerry Mander. Gibbles was spotted cheering loudly when Seger was called up to the stage to accept his award. Gibbles was also rumored to have invited the entire team to fly back to his Seal Beach home for an Outlaw Afterparty. The Press was unable to snap any pictures of the event as private security had kept the event exclusive.</td></tr><tr><td>StadiumGambler</td><td>357</td><td>Nick Brain was a periphery figure on the red carpet. He wasn't up for any awards, but took time out of his offseason workout schedule anyways to attend the event, and support Knute Knurtsson, Lillie Jacobs, and team captain Cassius Darrow in their award bids. Nick wore a borrowed suit bought at discount from Moore's, and arrived to the event (with several teammates in tow) in a rented version of his personal SUV/Station Wagon/Van hybrid vehicle that seats roughly 326 people. The parking valet was bribed by the team to block in a St. Louis Scarecrow parking space, but the valet screwed up and blocked in Gareth Rush's broken-down rented hummer-limousine instead.

Nick bumped shoulders with various teammates and rivals, and had a staredown with Troy Reynolds that ended when Troy fell for "Got your nose! Got your wallet!". He only took one question, from a wayward reporter asking about his relationship with Dan Curry. Nick replied that he was still looking for a dry-cleaner to get Curry's spit off his tracksuit.

Nick ran into two stars of note: One was Esa Anrikkanen, who Nick got an autograph from in exchange for a Chicken Parm Slider recipe. The other was the famous chef Gordon Ramsay, who turned out to be a secret superfan of the UK's endeavours in international hockey and had actually seen Nick play before. The two got a picture together, and Nick got some tips to step up various aspects of his cooking game, much to the future delight of many Colorado Raptors.

After Lillie and Knute finished celebrating their award wins, and after Cassius finished his semi-insane mutterings about a league-wide conspiracy to screw him over for the benefit of the St. Louis Scarecrows, the post-gaming broke up. Nick played designated driver and got people home to their hotel in good condiction and without a felony indictment, putting him one-up on anyone whos ever been responsible for sheperding the Halifax Raiders. This year was just a taste of the experience, but the hope was that next year, Nick would be onstage to accept some hardware after a Four Star Cup win by Denver's finest........</td></tr><tr><td>TnlAstatine</td><td>176</td><td>Luffy spent most of the day forgetting there even was a red carpet event. But his boys pulled up in their beat down van and they drove there just in time to be fashionably late. All the boys hoped out of the sketchy looking beat down van wearing the fly-est suits money could buy. Kidding they all wore their dads suits as they aren't really ready for this type of fame yet. As the players had all their meet and greets Luffy just got pretty drunk but not enough to make a fool out of himself. Catching up with his past teammates and fellow competitors whom he likes to shoot the shit with but also remind them they fucking suck from time to time. It was one hundred percent a great night filled with lots of laughs and when everybody was a little toasty a lot of dancing. It was a nice break from the get up and go lifestyle but we all know everybody is gonna be back to the grind in the following days.</td></tr><tr><td>ToeDragon84</td><td>0</td><td><a href="https://i.imgur.com/2Ipx5ba.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2Ipx5ba.png"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td>Troy_McClure03</td><td>194</td><td>"And now making his way to the start of the carpet is Troy McClure III of the Winnipeg Jets. Troy is rocking a 1987 Mustang GT, it appears to be a T-Top in mint green. He parks it right on the carpet and is having a dispute with the security team... it appears he has refused to give the keys to the valet, but is being told he can't park there... okay Troy is moving the car himself. While we wait for him.... "

15 minutes later


"... And Troy Is now walking up to the carpet! Took him a while to find a spot I guess. He is wearing a champion hoodie and what appears to be, sketchers? Man he is basically dressed like a bum. Uh looks like security is stopping him. Oh boy it appears they don't know who he is. A little back and forth. Oh Troy is now being escorted out of the event. Other SHL players appear to be ignoring Troy and security as he is being pushed down the carpet, what a shame. 


I guess he will have to watch How to Train your dragon 2 when it comes out to dvd!

Just like his playstyle, he's not the most flashy guy out there. He's been on the red carpet so many times in his career at this point that it's really not too big of a deal. Just another day. Maybe by the time he actually wins an award he'll just be wearing sweat pants and a hoodie. Below is Wilson's attire from the cup win in S43. 



At this point in his career, Wilson usually likes to sit with his teammates at the awards. So there's not too much drama going on between them either. It's really just a time to celebrate what the team and all the individuals have achieved or not achieved over the season. Back in his Riot days, however, Wilson was known to be a bit more outgoing at the awards shows. He used to have his own fashion line with Geronimo Otto that would outfit him to the nines.</td></tr><tr><td class="yellow">Wawazat</td><td>0</td><td>.</td></tr><tr><td class="yellow">Wawazat</td><td>391</td><td><a href="https://parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/The-Masked-Singer-72.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/The-Masked-Singer-72.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://www.bostoncostume.com/images/products/14338.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.bostoncostume.com/images/products/14338.jpg"></a><br>So I tried real hard to find this..




But, it was a no go..so I was just going to go get a regular suit. Drove over to the Men's Wearhouse and wouldn't you know right across the street was a costume shop. So I stroll in and ask about a Peacock thing from masked singer..
'Mrs. Doubtfire's twin sister behind the counter , she tilts her head down looks over her reader glasses and gives me a look up and down and says "No, NO ONE has a costume like that yet."
So dejectedly I start to head for the door. And the tailors at Mens Wearhouse across the boulevard. But, then... I see it ,it's perfect. It's the perfect Suit for this BS affair..
Now I promised Gordie a ride over from the hotel and it was a little difficult getting in and out of the rental S550 . And the big boots added to my heavy foot burned the tires off that bznitch at every stoplight.
But, the looks were priceless. Yea Boomhover was slightly embarrassed to be near me for the walk up the carpet ..and I photo bombed a couple of interviews and Super slow motion moon walked past most of the paparazzi. Gordie was way ahead of me and just shaking his head.. I waved to McScruff and I read his lips as he mouthed out "You Demented MF'r!!"
It would've been awesome to have carried the 4 Star Cup up the carpet. Maybe if we THREEPEAT I'll get the chance.
When we reached the seating,they put most of the Crows on the same row the bitch was I couldn't hardly fit in the chair in this damn suit and the F'n thing got real sweaty. So naturally I drank a little more multiple large flasks were passed around and the hostess they assigned us was kept busy with orders .You know when attending a formal occasion you gotta keep your intake of fluids high ..I mean you wouldn't want to dehydrate. Felt bad when Hoov (Ty Hoover)and Foxman (Mike Fox) got F'd outta the awards. Tried cheering Hoov up by telling him if he didn't cheer up we'd put him in this suit and let Jerry Larry fart in the oxygen line. .Yea it was mediocre but, hey I tried.
In case you were wondering ...Here's my Suit.</td></tr><tr><td>Weretarantula</td><td>441</td><td>This is E! Hockey and we are on the red carpet at the SHL Awards ceremony! Our next guest is only a Calgary Dragons prospect, but we'll interview him anyway! Welcome Maxime Bouchard! We've just got a few questions for you...

Run us through your outfit here, what are you wearing?
I just went with a run of the mill tux, this is actually one of Mike Izzy's funnily enough. Dude has been in the game so long he's got everything already. I really like this purple waistcoat though, the man has good taste!

Oh that was nice of him! Who is it made by?
Let me just check the tags here... oh shit! Ralph Lauren made this one, it even has Ralph Lifshitz signature on it. Guess Izzy dropped some big cash on it. It is pretty comfy I'm not gonna lie.

We didn't see what you arrived in, anything special?
I didn't wanna grab a limo, so I hired a chauffeur and a cherry red 1957 Chevy Bel Air. Think I'm gonna see what the owner wants for it after this is all over, the thing is gorgeous.

Old school! Very nice. Anyone come with you tonight?
Haha I thought about flying my Mum out to it, but I haven't even played a season yet, so that will probably be next years attendee!

We like to change it up a little with our red carpet interviews so we have an odd question for you now. Who spends the longest in the shower?
Well I've only done a couple training sessions with the rest of the guys, but man it has to be Shooter McGavin. He does this weird thing where he stares you directly in the eyes as he washes himself too. It's uh, interesting. I think he does it to all of the guys, so he won't actually get out until he's creeped everyone.

Well that was an unexpected answer... Who are you sitting next to tonight?
Pretty sure Otis B. Driftwood has reserved a space for me at the table next to him. I love that guy, his moustache is even more epic when you see it in person!

Lastly, we like to shake things up around here, you know the nature of the media they'll grab anything they can. Wanna give us a joking controversial line we can turn into clickbait shamelessly?
Sure why not, then people might actually know my name! I heard Rex Kirkby of West Kendall and Willy Mack of Edmonton were caught going into a hotel together during the playoffs... Won't go into anymore detail than that though! Haha cheers for the interview
Thank you Maxime!</td></tr></table>
